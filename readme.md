# openbim-components playground

This playground allows you to pick an ifc file and have it processed through the `FragmentIfcStreamConverter`. It will create all necessary tile files for streaming.

Select a file and hit submit. The file will be converted and the browser will prompt you to download the result.

> Use Chrome or Edge. Download is handled through the FileSystemAPI, which hasn't landed in all browsers yet.

## getting started

```bash
# install dependencies
npm i
# run devserver
npm run dev
```
